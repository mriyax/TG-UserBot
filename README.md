# TG-UserBot

[![Documentation Status][docsbadge]][docs]

A modular Telegram UserBot for Python which uses the [Telethon][telethon] library. It is made to help you do your usual client tasks without the hassle and also has some additional useful features.

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above.
- A Telegram [API key][tg-apps] (API ID and hash).

### Procedure

Clone the repository.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/kandnub/TG-UserBot/
```

Change the current directory to the cloned one.

```sh
$ cd TG-UserBot
```

Edit the ``sample_config.ini`` with your API key, save it and rename it to ``config.ini``.
You can use nano/vim or do it manually using a text editor.

```sh
$ nano sample_config.ini
$ mv sample_config.ini config.ini
```

Install all the requirements using pip.

```sh
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
